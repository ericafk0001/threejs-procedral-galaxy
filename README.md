# Procedurally Generated Galaxy in Three.js

## Overview

This project is a 3D visualization of a procedurally generated galaxy built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The aim is to create an interactive and visually stunning galaxy simulation that showcases the capabilities of procedural generation and 3D rendering in modern web development. 🌌✨🌠

## Features

- **Realistic Star Placement**: Procedurally generated stars with adjustable density and distribution.
- **Interactive Camera**: Pan, zoom, and rotate to explore the galaxy.
- **Dynamic Star Systems**: Includes star clusters, nebulae, and random celestial bodies.
- **Customizable Settings**: Easily modify galaxy size, star count, colors, and other parameters.
- **Optimized Rendering**: Efficiently renders thousands of stars for smooth performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: Core library for 3D rendering and visualization.
- **JavaScript**: Main programming language for procedural algorithms and interactivity.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic structure and styling of the application. 💻🔧🌟

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for running a local development server)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) with WebGL support 🌍⚙️🖥️

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ericafk0001/threejs-procedral-galaxy
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd threejs-procedral-galaxy
   ```

3. Start live server via vscode live server (or http server):

4. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5500/`. 🚀🌌🛠️

### Customization

The galaxy parameters can be modified directly in the JavaScript configuration file (`config/galaxyConfig.js`). Key parameters include:

- **Galaxy Size**: Adjust the overall radius of the galaxy.
- **Star Count**: Set the number of stars to render.
- **Color Schemes**: Define custom colors for stars and nebulae. 🎨✨🔭

### Controls

- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out.
- **Left Click + Drag**: Rotate the galaxy.
- **Right Click + Drag**: Pan the camera. 🖱️🌠🔧
